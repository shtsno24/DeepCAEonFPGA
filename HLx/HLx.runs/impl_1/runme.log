WARNING: [DRC REQP-1839] RAMB36 async control check: The RAMB36E1 design_1_i/network_dma/network_0/inst/MemBank_A_U/network_MemBank_A_ram_U/ram_reg_0 has an input control pin design_1_i/network_dma/network_0/inst/MemBank_A_U/network_MemBank_A_ram_U/ram_reg_0/ADDRARDADDR[14] (net: design_1_i/network_dma/network_0/inst/MemBank_A_U/network_MemBank_A_ram_U/ADDRARDADDR[13]) which is driven by a register (design_1_i/axi_interconnect_0/m00_couplers/auto_pc/inst/gen_axi4_axi3.axi3_conv_inst/USE_WRITE.write_addr_inst/USE_B_CHANNEL.cmd_b_queue/inst/fifo_gen_inst/inst_fifo_gen/gconvfifo.rf/grf.rf/gntv_or_sync_fifo.gl0.wr/gwss.wsts/ram_full_i_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
