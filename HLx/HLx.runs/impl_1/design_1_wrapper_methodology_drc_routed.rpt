2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.010 ns between design_1_i/network_0/inst/ap_CS_fsm_reg[52]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and design_1_i/network_0/inst/MemBank_B_U/network_MemBank_B_ram_U/ram_reg_3/ADDRBWRADDR[2] (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.014 ns between design_1_i/network_0/inst/ap_CS_fsm_reg[52]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and design_1_i/network_0/inst/MemBank_B_U/network_MemBank_B_ram_U/ram_reg_2/ADDRBWRADDR[2] (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.017 ns between design_1_i/network_0/inst/ap_CS_fsm_reg[52]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and design_1_i/network_0/inst/MemBank_B_U/network_MemBank_B_ram_U/ram_reg_7/ADDRBWRADDR[2] (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.115 ns between design_1_i/network_0/inst/ap_CS_fsm_reg[52]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and design_1_i/network_0/inst/MemBank_B_U/network_MemBank_B_ram_U/ram_reg_5/ADDRBWRADDR[2] (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
