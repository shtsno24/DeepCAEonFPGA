TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.024 ns between design_1_i/axi_dma_out/U0/I_PRMRY_DATAMOVER/GEN_S2MM_FULL.I_S2MM_FULL_WRAPPER/GEN_INCLUDE_REALIGNER.I_S2MM_REALIGNER/GEN_INCLUDE_SCATTER.I_S2MM_SCATTER/sig_max_first_increment_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and design_1_i/axi_dma_out/U0/I_PRMRY_DATAMOVER/GEN_S2MM_FULL.I_S2MM_FULL_WRAPPER/GEN_INCLUDE_REALIGNER.I_S2MM_REALIGNER/GEN_INCLUDE_SCATTER.I_S2MM_SCATTER/sig_btt_cntr_dup_reg[9]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
